An API — Application Program Interface — is a special form of code that allows two programs to communicate with each other.</br>
## Hosted APIs
Are APIs you provide to enable external parties to connect to your computer system. Your data will be made available externally. In the form of Open/Public APIs or Partner APIs. It enables your customer and partners to automate the interactions with your company, making your operations more efficient.
## Consuming APIs
You can use services from external parties, by connecting to their APIs. Rather than building your own mapping, payment, or communication service you can use third parties. This rapidly expands your capabilities and avoids the costs and risks of developing your own.
## Automation
This is the key paradigm of our age. It really dates back to the start of the industrial revolution, but with powerful computer systems it is accelerating rapidly. To stay viable into the future this must be the main focus of every business. We leverage the API ecosystem to drive your automation.
